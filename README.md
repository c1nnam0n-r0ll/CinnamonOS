# CinnamonOS
I am putting a pause on this project. No, I am not abandoning this project. I know myself and certain MGMT songs enough to know,
"Even if I choose to believe that it's ending I'll come back to it again. The last part of the lyrics don't even fit here."
For now, I will be working on other projects still relating to operating systems but like... not a full operating system.
Alr, later. 
Tbf, I don't think I'm actually talking to anyone because the only person with this starred is just someone I forced to make a GitHub account to make this project more impressive.
If certain people are watching, the world was miserable in 1492.
I'll be back.
